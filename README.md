# Final-Terrain-Project
Welcome! This is my final terrain project for Game Design Spring 2016.
Use the character I downloaded off the asset store, Unity-chan, and navigate my terrain inspired by Skyrim's Riverwood!
You begin high above in the mountain region- follow the cobblestone path to interesting locations!
Follow the ramp down- either go right to the small lake, left to the single island where a hermit lives, or straight into the village.
Once inside, explore the dock, run around the houses, or go up the hill and visit the temple! (be aware, it is ghostly and people have been
known to pass through its ruins despite having rigidbody components...)

Up the hill, there is also a small ledge where you can see the village from above.

Enjoy!
